# AdvancedBaseSAS
Repo holding some work done in SAS for my reference.
It is based on assignments and solutions developed based on the assignments. 
Assignment is a small use case to be solved via SAS.
Idea is to use the assignments/use cases and program it via SAS. 
Coverage - SQL Programming, Macros, Perf benching, Advanced techniques mainly but covers other things as well.
Assignments came from Tamu- credit to Prof Faron Kincheloe.
